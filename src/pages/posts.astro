        <!-- Front page with the table of contents -->
        <p>
            Some of these articles were written for <a href="http://a320.emulate.su">a320.emulate.su</a> (now defunct) in
            2012-2016 during the boom of cheap Dingux-based handhelds. Unfortunately, the site was abandoned since January
            2019, so putting the information here for safety.
